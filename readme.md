#Resume builder

This is a resume builder tool I created in a 24 hour speed hackathon using only html css and typescript. then it's told to update this and make it more professional, as it's built on html css and ts, it's so frustrating to keep fixing it. becuase I spent my time on functionality instead of UI but now our teachers priority is to have a good UI :). 

I want community and my mates to contribute in here and fix it more with me.

Potential bugs

1. Home page is so basic
2. create resume page UI is ðŸ’©
3. Edit resume page isn't responsive
4. Edit page have few bugs, Like bullets do append in the page but techinaclly they should append where the cursor is and so on.
5. Edit and sharelink wont work if image is given to the resume, because its converted into base64 and the data is passed to throught the link which can't handle base64 long strings.
